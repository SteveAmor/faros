# Faros

Faros is a GitOps controller that takes a Git repository reference from a Custom Resource Definition (CRD) and applies resources within the repository to a Kubernetes cluster.

Note: This is a proof of concept in the early alpha stage. We are providing no guarantees and recommend that you test and thoroughly understand the project before deploying to production.
